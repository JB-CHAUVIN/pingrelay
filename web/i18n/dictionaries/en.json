      {
        "q": "How does PingRelay work?",
        "a": "PingRelay automatically sends personalized WhatsApp messages to your participants before, during and after your webinars. You schedule your messages once (reminders, access, replay...), and PingRelay takes care of sending them at the right time."
      },
      {
        "q": "Can I customize the automatic messages?",
        "a": "Absolutely. You can create your own message templates with custom variables (first name, webinar date, access link, replay, etc.). Variables are automatically replaced for each participant."
      },
      {
        "q": "Is it compliant with WhatsApp rules?",
        "a": "Messages are sent via technology based on WhatsApp Web. Security rules and best practices are applied to minimize the risk of restriction or ban."
      },
      {
        "q": "Do participants need to have given their consent?",
        "a": "Yes. PingRelay is designed to be used only with contacts who have explicitly agreed to receive your messages (webinar registration, opt-in, existing relationship)."
      },
      {
        "q": "How many messages can I send?",
        "a": "The sending volume depends on your usage and the chosen plan. Smart limits are applied to preserve your WhatsApp account security."
      },
      {
        "q": "Is my data secure?",
        "a": "Yes. Data is used only for sending messages and is never resold. We apply security measures to protect your information and that of your participants."
      },
      {
        "q": "Can I stop automation at any time?",
        "a": "Of course. You can activate, deactivate or modify your campaigns at any time from your dashboard."
      },
      {
        "q": "Can I get a refund?",
        "a": "Yes. You can request a refund within 7 days of your purchase. Just contact us by email and we will process your request quickly."

      {
        "q": "I have another question",
